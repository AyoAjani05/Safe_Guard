# Safe Guard (Emergency Contact Directory Web App) 🚑

## 📌 Project Overview

**CPE 407 Group 2 Project | Status: In Development**

The **Emergency Contact Directory** will be a cross-platform web application built with Flutter. It is being designed to serve as a reliable, centralized hub for emergency information across the country. By providing a clean, accessible interface, the app will ensure that critical contact details for **Police, Fire Services, and Hospitals** for all states are never more than a click away.

## 🚀 Planned Features

* **Nationwide Geo-Fencing:** The app **will provide** dedicated contact directories for every state, moving beyond regional limitations to ensure national coverage.
* **Intuitive Search Interface:** Users **will be able to** quickly filter through states and emergency departments using a responsive search bar.
* **One-Click Dialing:** Since it is a web app, it **will leverage** browser-based URI schemes to allow users on mobile browsers to initiate calls with a single tap.
* **Print-Friendly Directory:** A core feature **will be** the ability to generate clean, printer-ready pages of state-specific contacts for physical posting in homes or offices.
* **Responsive Web Design:** The layout **will adapt** seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers to ensure accessibility on any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Flutter for Web](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/web)
* **Language:** Dart
* **Key Packages:**
* `url_launcher`: For handling "tel:" links and external web redirects.
* `google_fonts`: For clear, professional typography.
